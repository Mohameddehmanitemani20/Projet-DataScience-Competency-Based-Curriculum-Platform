Specifically, I developed and trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models to distinguish between MRI images of tuberculosis, COVID-19, and healthy kidneys.

In addition to implementing the CNN models, I also created a web application with a user-friendly interface for doctors to use in their decision-making processes. The front-end of the application was built with ReactJS, while the back-end utilized the Flask Python framework to deploy and load the models via API.

I have chosen this domain because I always liked math and statistics, and it was a big dream for me to use them and see the result of this complex theorem solving real world problems. I also like poetry and reading books. 

During my 5 years exploring the IT domain, I have developed many soft skills, starting with teamwork and stress management, including quickly learning new programming languages ,problem solving, and optimization . C/C++, SQL, Python, git, time series analysis, machine learning, deep learning, plotly, dash, NLP, Django, and TensorFlow are the tools I've used so far.


I also worked on many projects, such as the implementation of an automation system for checking bank checks , making it possible to extract table layout and content from pdf files and images into an Excel sheet using the Azure Form Recognizer API and the openpyxl library, and finally, analysis and modeling of a time-series dataset of household electricity consumption using ARIMA, LSTM, and Facebook Prophet models. The main objective is to forecast the following year's consumption to minimize the cost of the invoice.

Please feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I'm always looking forward to meeting new people, having new adventures, and improving myself.

There is no wire between the car and the controller,  why does it move when I push the buttons? What makes it follow my order correctly to turn left or right? I was curious to understand what was happening inside. A few days later I decided to unscrew it. I was fascinated by the process and discovering the different parts, the engine, the damper and the circuitry.the most intriguing part was a green piece of plastic which my father told me it is the PCB, where all the program is stored to handle the actions between the car and what I want it to execute. That was the moment when a spark light in my brain, the passion to know more about what is a program? how to make it and how to put it in the work ? My beautiful car was lost. I was unable to assemble it back, some parts were broken but I learned a great lesson and a new passion.
This passion carried me through the years of my education to grasp advanced topics like programming, computer science, mathematics, and machine learning. For me every course was interesting to learn if it is a step to build highly automated pieces of software which point me toward machine learning and the importance of data which contain human expertise that can be intuitively injected into algorithms to mimic various types of  patterns.
Now as a senior data scientist I’m lucky to say that my daily job is also my passion. I was able to put in practice those accumulated skills to leverage business challenges and help shape the strategic decision of the company.

I graduated in 2020 from the Private Higher School of Engineering and Technology (ESPRIT) as a Computer science engineer specialized in Business intelligence and data science. During this time, I have gained the ability to work in groups and to develop practical experience and a very good knowledge of Business Intelligence, Data Visualization, Machine learning, Deep learning, and Python development.

My end of studies internship was also a step to dig deeper in the Data Science field, artificial intelligence, Django, Elasticsearch, and kibana which allowed me to confirm my passion for the data domain, to develop an extreme rigor, and to begin to master concepts and practices of this field.
 
Recently, I was selected to be part of the SAP Young Professional Program (YPP) during which I participated in various Soft skills, public speaking workshops, and technical courses as I was certified in the SAP S/4 Hana Business Process and Intergration (1909) and SuccessFactors - Employee Central.
After the YPP program, I continued my learning journey with SAP as I was also certified in SAP S/4HANA Sourcing and Procurement, SAP S/4HANA Sales 1909, and Extended Warehouse Management with SAP S/4HANA.

A highly and motivated businees intelligence consultant  at polycor. INC (QUÉBEC) whose dream is to solve real life problems with bi technics  . 

 Very comfortable with figures and statistics, I like to give them meaning and see them impact reality. Data analysis was therefore an ideal discipline for me. To achieve this, I turned to a master's degree in Business Analytics at Esprit school of Business in Tunis,  which is complementary to my license's degree in Finance.

I have done a lot of internships Since that, I had the opportunity to carry out several missions such as consultant bi intern for a specific project . These short experiences allowed me to discover in a short time different markets, different types of companies and different analysis programs.

Indeed, these experiences allowed me to acquire many skills that cannot be learned at school such as:Ability to work in a team, to resume a mission at a moment's notice, to organize priorities, to respect deadlines, to present exploitable results ... These skills will allow me to quickly offer you useful analyzes for the development of your company.

Recent work [1] indicates that bacterial growth is realistically represented by so-called ""self-replicator"" models. These dynamic models in which the allocation of resources reflects the ""choices"" made by the bacteria between different internal mechanisms allow the use of an optimal control approach to describe its behaviour. Several criteria are then possible: maximization of growth, maximization of the production of a product of interest... We are interested in the numerical resolution of this type of problem by direct or indirect approaches in the Julia language.
