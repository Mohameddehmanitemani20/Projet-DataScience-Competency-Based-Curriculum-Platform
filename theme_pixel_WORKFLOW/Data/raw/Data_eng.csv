The platform is developed with Angular on the Front-End and Spring Boot on the Back End.

Goal:
- Automate CI/CD chains to deploy a Cloud Native HRIS Called solution ""Talenteo"" on a Kubernetes Cluster managed by Microsoft Azure (AKS) using Azure DevOps.

Tasks:
* Configure a pipeline to supply an Azure infrastructure using Terraform (Cluster AKS, Blob Storage, Azure Container Registry, Vnet and Subnets).
* Setting up three namesspaces on AKS (Dev, Int, Prod).
* Deploy PostgreSQL in Statefulset on AKS using Helm and configure database schemas and users.
* Dockerize the Back-End micro-services (Spring Boot) with Jib and use a dockerfile to contain the Front-End part (Angular 9).
* use Helm to make dynamic Kubernetes resources declarations (Ingress, Deployments, Services, Secrets, TLS certificate) by injecting inside the concerned values from a separated files entitled values.yml. Each intended environment such as Dev, Int or Prod has its own values.
* Implementation automated CI/CD pipelines for each microservice and the Front-End part (from GitLab --> Azure DevOps pipelines Build --> Azure DevOps pipelines Release --> AKS).
* Ensure own cost management on Azure (Kubecost).
* Create Pull Requests for major changes done on existing files in GitLab reste (git).

- Talenteo is a native SIRH Cloud solution that covers all HRD management processes: recruitment, training, careers, missions, editing and sending CVs, co-ops, monitoring and evaluation of consultants. The platform is developed with Angular side Front-End and Spring Boot side Back-End.

Objective:
- Automation of CI/CD channels to deploy a native SIRH Cloud solution called ""Talenteo"" on a cluster Kubernetes managed by Microsoft Azure (AKS) using Azure DevOps.

Tasks completed:
* Configure a pipeline to supply an Azure infrastructure using Terraform (AKS, Blob Storage, Azure Container Registry, Vnet and Subnets).
* Three namespaces were set up on AKS (Dev, Int, Prod).
* Deploy PostgreSQL in Statefulset on AKS using Helm and configure the schemas and users of the database.
* Dockerize the Back-End side micro-services (Spring Boot) with Jib and use a dockerfile to containerize the Front-End part (Angular 9).
* Template Kubernetes objects to deploy using Helm (Ingress, Deployments, Services, Secrets, TLS certificate).
* Implement the automated CI/CD chain for each microservice (from GitLab --> Azure DevOps pipelines Build --> Azure DevOps pipelines Release --> AKS).
* Ensure proper cost management on Azure (Kubecost).
* Create Pull Requests for major changes made to existing files in GitLab rest (git).

Recent work [1] indicators that bilateral growth is realistically represented by so-called ""self-replicator"" models. These dynamic models in which the allocation of resources reflects the ""choices"" made by the bacteria between different internal mechanisms allow the use of an optimal control approach to describe its behaviour. Several criteria are then possible: maximization of growth, maximization of the production of a product of interest... We are interested in the numerical resolution of this type of problem by direct or indirect approaches in the Julia language.

61,Postdoctoral Researcher - Lightning Resistance of Composites in Aeronautics,Mechanical,Thermodynamics,Aerodynamics,Turbomachines,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,Aeronautics,"KEY WORDS: 
Experimental research, modelling, composite materials, lightning protection, aeronautics

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: 
Aircraft and helicopters are struck by lightning on average once a year, which can seriously damage materials at the fuselage impact point. The solutions currently used are to apply a copper mesh to the materials to improve their electrical conductivity and thus distribute the energy of the impact over the whole fuselage rather than at a specific point. However, copper meshes increase aircraft weight, resulting in fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. 

My goal is to develop new lightning protection solutions, both more effective and lighter.  Different types of coatings are being studied, including nickel and silver. 

ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Creation of new design of innovative materials
- Definition and execution of experimental tests: lightning tests (ARP5412), damage analysis with a C-Scan and CT-Scan, mechanical bending tests (ASTM D6272), chemical tests
- Modelling of electrical, thermal and chemical processes in a material exposed to lightning
- Technological monitoring of existing lightning protection solutions
- Project management: definition of need with partner, communication with suppliers, allocation of resources
- Preparation of scientific reports and articles

TECHNICAL ENVIRONMENT:
- Experimentation: Lightning gun, C-Scan, CT-Scan, TGA, DSC, Reflectometer, infrared camera, voltage machine, cutting machines
- Modeling: Comsol, Python
- Language of the project: English",Materials Researcher - Teacher - Self-entrepreneur - Self-entrepreneur,Teacher,"I am a teacher at Polytechnique Montréal's Material Resistance II course:

An artificial intelligence algorithm that allows dynamic optimization to calculate the shortest path. This track will be sent to the collection service (for unloading vehicles) in real time. Thus, the municipality (agent of the municipality) can have a detailed follow-up of the status of the dumping process such as: last dumping of each bin, status of bins at that time, etc. Every citizen should be able to consult the condition of the latest crash can to their home and beware when passing garage vehicles.",unckown,unckown,unckown
