There have been numerous moments in my life that made me sure that I got that gift. Even since I was a kid, I was a lover of sciences and computers. I was the kind of kid who really had a tough time putting down a book once I pick it up and, well, this passion of mine made me take in the challenges of the ever changing IT world.

Currently a 2nd year engineering student in ESPRIT specialized in IoT technologies, I have been embracing teamwork and got the chance to work with amazing and talented classmates, creating 4 projects throughout my three years studying in ESPRIT. I also had integrated into Inceptum JE as a project department member then a quality department member, which helped me get more insight into project realization and quality control.

I have been also working as a public relations coordinator in Elbaladiya.tn, a revolutionary project that digitizes municipality in order to improve the citizen relationship with the municipality.

Curiosity--the desire to approach novel and challenging ideas and experiences in order to increase one's knowledge--also lead me to want to know about people and interact with them.

I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives. Reach out if you want to talk to me about emerging tech, creating software products or TV series.

I am in my 5th year student in the IOT (internet of things) specialty at ESPRIT and I have one more step towards obtaining my diploma, therefore I am looking for an end-of-study internship for this year. My Email:ghassenmechmech1@gmail.com as well you can contact me for any opportunities.

Moreover, I am a multitasking person, ambitious and I like to challenge myself.
I was able to acquire the necessary skills to carry out the various missions. I did a summer internship at Orange Tunisia, my project is to make an assistive device for blind people where I participated in the Orange Summer challenge with this project and I got the  third place and the skills that I practiced his:
-Java
-Spring boot
-JavaScript
-Express js
-GITHUB
-Docker
- LiDAR •
-Robot Operating System (ROS) •
-React.js
- Embedded Systems
- Python (Programming Language) •
-Node.js
As well as my internship at SAGEMCOM which involved developing and implementing a test system for electronic terminals. The first solution used camera and deep learning (Tensorflow,PYTHON), and the second solution was implemented using LABVIEW's embedded computer vision

I have a very sociable personality that's why you will find me in many organizations and associations like the Scout. My professional career has therefore allowed me to develop my interpersonal skills and my skills.

I look forward to learning new skills and applying my old ones.
That's all I can say about me! If you want to know more about me, we can work together.

I still remember sitting in front of my first Microlux computer when I was about 11 and trying to figure out how to use a mouse and keyboard. As I went through the basics, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted,then after a few years I learned about programming by then I was only limited by my own imagination and ingenuity. 
Throughout middle and high school, I latched on to any ideas,configurations and projects I could get, moving from ""Hello World"" to matrix effect using command prompt all the way to a simple maze video game , with dozens of small projects in between. I learned Pascal then C, tearing through any stuff I could find on anything remotely related to IT. I was insatiable. 
This passion carried me through my education at ISETN and then Esprit. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers , sensors , microcontrollers all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was there where I learned Embedded Systems ,I dived more into the Hardware and then I discovered the IoT & AI world which I'am embracing right now.
So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
